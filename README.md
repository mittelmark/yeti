# yeti
Yeti - parser and scanner generator for Tcl

This is a fork of the yeti package of Frank Pilhofer. The package has vanished from the internet. See the [Tcl Wiki](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Yeti) for more details. I added a few bugfixes, removed the tcl++ support and bumpbed the package version to 0.5 to distinguish it clearly from the Frank Pilhofer's version. The Copyright stays at it is, a BSD License.
